            <Paragraph>
              Travel agents appeared first as an intermediary between travelers and hotels
              in order to facilitate trip planning. While the internet has left brick and mortar
              travel agencies largely obsolete, they do still exist and are often helpful in
              booking group trips.

                planning from the customer and provide individualized travel suggestions.
                Further, the hotel industry stands to benefit since the commission rates
                can be negotiated on a case by case basis.

            <Paragraph>
              Global distribution systems originally began in the airline industry (eAAsy
              Sabre) to provide a central platform for airlines and travel agents to aggregate
              flight data. By 1991, the Hotel Reservation Network (now Hotels.com)
              was founded to extend this idea directly to the customer for hotel bookings using
              a toll-free phone number. Currently, global distribution systems are largely
              outdated and seeking ways to reinvent themselves since online travel agents are
              now able to bypass their networks and work directly with the service providers
              (i.e hotels, airlines, and rental car companies).
            </Paragraph>
            <CustomListItem>
              <div>&#8226;</div>
              <div><i className="underline">Value:</i> The benefit of a global distribution system lies in itâ€™s network and
              the consequent ability to bundle airline deals with hotel and car rental
              service providers. However, online travel agents (OTAs) are now able
              to provide the same service directly to the traveler which has left global
              distribution systems looking for ways to stay relevant.

              <div>&#8226;</div>
              <p><i className="underline">Cost:</i> Availability and pricing information can be slow and spotty since
              global distribution systems typically act between service providers and
              travel agents rather than communicating directly with the travelers.
