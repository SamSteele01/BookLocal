                            The ultimate goal for BookLocal is to maintain itâ€™s own plasma subchain (or
                            similar off-chain solution) to handle the bulk of the transactional data. This
                            works to reduce the number of updates to the main Ethereum chain and thus
                            save in transaction fees and increase speed. Further, upon making a
                            reservation, a new subchain (or payment channel) could be created for the
                            hotel guest (a traveler who commits to a hotel becomes a guest) and will
                            terminate upon checkout whereby the final balances are settled. Visually we
                            represent the flow of data below:

                        With BookLocal, the traveler will be able to search, compare, and book a hotel
                        room. Additionally, we will incorporate a wallet feature that allows the guest
                        to use their phone to pay for dinner, events, or other travel related activities.

                        The search feature will be a read only function (i.e. constant insofar as it
                        cannot update the blockchain) that searches for available rooms during your
                        travel. Our vision for this feature is to allow the guest to search the hotel in a
                        visually intuitive manor whereby they can view the hotel, select the floor, and
                        finally look at a view of the entire floor plan to select from available rooms.
                        This feature gives control to the traveler to decide exactly which room and view
                        they want.

                        for a day and night in Paris. She uses BookLocal to find a hotel that costs
                        $100 per night and decide to book. Since she already knows her desired budget
                        for the weekend, she chooses to book the room by transferring all $400 to the
                        BookLocal holding address. A new subchain is created for her stay which now
                        includes $300 in the wallet to spend in Paris ($400 less $100 for room). Now
                        Ann is able to use the BookLocal app to eat, shop, go to museums, and so on.
                        If at the end of her trip she only spent $250 in total (including room), and
                        there are no room disputes or damages, then the remaining $150 that she
                        didnâ€™t spend will be immediately returned to her upon checkout.
