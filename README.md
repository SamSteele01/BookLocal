# EthMemphis
The first version booking app made for EthMemphis

This project was created using Truffle unbox React, and uses the [Grommet UI](http://grommet.io/) component library. Barely.

The ```npm run dev``` command runs a localhost and listens for changes in the .scss files. Don't change the .css file, it won't persist. You need [sass installed](https://sass-lang.com/install) globally on your machine to use this script. 

Master branch is what is deployed on [Heroku](booklocal-prospectus.herokuapp.com)

Dev merges pull requests from other branches.

Pull from Dev and then make a branch with your name or the issue you are working on. Only push to that branch. Pull from Dev and merge, and run locally to catch errors before opening a pull request.
