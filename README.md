## Book Local

This project uses the [Grommet UI](http://grommet.io/) component library. 

The ```npm run dev``` command needs [sass installed](https://sass-lang.com/install) globally to work. 

Master branch is what is deployed on [Heroku](booklocal-prospectus.herokuapp.com)

Dev merges pull requests from other branches.

Rearrange is to experiment with changing the content and order of the whitepaper.

Max width is set in index.css. Comment out to work on responsive issues.
