# BookLocal Front-end

This repo is for the Traveler interfaces. It interacts with the smart contract and the backend server.

To run locally: clone or fork, ```npm install```, and ```npm start```.

To make changes to the style sheets: the ```npm run dev``` command runs a localhost and listens for changes in the .scss files. Don't change the .css file, it won't persist. You need [sass installed](https://sass-lang.com/install) globally on your machine to use this script.

Master branch is what is currently deployed. I may not be the most up to date.

Dev merges pull requests from other branches.

Pull from Dev and then make a branch with your name or the issue you are working on. Only push to that branch.

Pull from Dev, merge to your branch, and run locally to catch errors before opening a pull request.

## Documentation

The docs folder has lots of reading material. Not all of the suggestions have been implemented yet.
